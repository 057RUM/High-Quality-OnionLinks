# High-Quality-OnionLinks

Some High quality onion links to browse while using TOR's encrypted network. Btw for saftey and high quality privacy I put the names for the onion links in unicode btw unicode is an international character encoding standard that provides a unique number for every character across languages and scripts And In case you don't know Onions aka "onion sites" are websites on the dark web That use The Onion Router (Tor) software to encrypt their connections and enable anonymous communication. They also hide their location, ownership, and other identifiers.
Anyways here they are

Oh and like I said before onion links in a more advanced definition are basically websites on the dark web that use the “.onion” top-level domain instead of “.com,” “.net,” “.gov,” etc. So as a result Onion sites use The Onion Router (Tor) software to encrypt their connections and enable anonymous communication. They also hide their location, ownership, and other identifiers. By the way Onion routing is a sophisticated means to prevent tracking your location, but there's no such thing as perfect online anonymity. Although your internet traffic is encrypted on Tor, your ISP can still see that you're connected to Tor so be careful

Hi guys if your going to give my onion links to a freind please stay anonymous also although using Tor or visiting the Dark Web are not unlawful in themselves. It is of course illegal to carry out illegal acts anonymously, such as accessing child abuse images, promoting terrorism, or selling illegal items such as weapons. So futher more I am not responsble for any danger or manipulation that you get yourself into because I trust that most of you guys will use these links in caution
If you have any complaintents please DM me on any of my socials also even though it is possible to stay safe on the dark web it's generally impossible to stay fully and have perfect anonymity so below I listed some high quality tips for you guys

1 - Make sure you use a VPN to hide your loctation
2 - Rememeber to get an anti virus from a trusted software
3 - If you plan on buying angel's powder "wink wink" or crystal powder please pay with Bitcoin I'm only saying that so you could stay fully secure and private
4 - Use PGP while buying, emailing, texting, and calling
5 - Don't go on websites that contain morbidly fucked up content because it's just disgusting but spefically those with CP and I'm pretty sure that by this time and age you guys know that the term CP on the obscure side of the internet dosen't stand for club penguin ... iykwim
6 - In your settings turn the security level to "SAFEST" not safter, not standard, but SAFEST
7 ... - just don't do stupid shit and finally number 8 being the last one never ever give out your personal information 

Note : I am not suggesting that you prompt out any illegal activites let alone go on illegal sites I am simply helping you by giving you tips on how to stay safe
DISCLAIMER : I am not responsible for the harm, manipulation, abuse, if it happens of you, your freind, your family member, or your parents. Due to the fact that you know who you ARE so like I said please use these links with caution and stay safe ...

Btw in case anyone dosen't know what TOR is let me tell you
TOR short for "The Onion Router" is a free and open source software for enabling anonymous communication. It directs Internet traffic via a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network that consists of more than seven thousand relays.

So Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace a user's Internet activity. Tor protects personal privacy by concealing a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or traffic analysis. It protects the user's freedom and ability to communicate confidentially through IP address anonymity using Tor exit nodes.
Anyways In case you dont know The core principle of Tor, onion routing, was developed in the mid-1990s by United States Naval Research Laboratory employees, mathematician Paul Syverson, and computer scientists Michael G. Reed and David Goldschlag, to protect American intelligence communications online. Onion routing is implemented by means of encryption in the application layer of the communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an onion. The alpha version of Tor, developed by Syverson and computer scientists Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson and then called The Onion Routing project which was later given the acronym "Tor" was launched on 20 September 2002. The first public release occurred a year later. In 2004, the Naval Research Laboratory released the code for Tor under a free license, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) began funding Dingledine and Mathewson to continue its development. So In 2006, Dingledine, Mathewson, and five others founded  The Tor Project, a Massachusetts-based 501(c)research-education nonprofit organization responsible for maintaining Tor. The EFF acted as The Tor Project's fiscal sponsor in its early years, and early financial supporters included the U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor and International Broadcasting Bureau, Internews, Human Rights Watch, the University of Cambridge, Google, and Netherlands-based Stichting NLnet. Over the course of its existence, various Tor weaknesses have been discovered and occasionally exploited. Attacks against Tor are an active area of academic research that is welcomed by The Tor Project itself. Tor enables its users to surf the Internet, chat and send instant messages anonymously, and is used by a wide variety of people for both licit and illicit purposes.
